# SlightSway
SlightSway is a life-changing project developed using Arduino technology, designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings safely. With the aid of sensors and a buzzer system, it provides real-time feedback and alerts, helping the blind to walk with confidence and avoid obstacles.
This project would require you having a setup with a arduino board and a sensor as well.
